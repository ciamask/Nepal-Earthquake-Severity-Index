# Nepal-Earthquake-Severity-Index


# Abstract

A predictive model was developed using a Decision Tree Classifier to assess earthquake severity in Nepal with an accuracy rate of 95%. The model was trained and tested on a dataset of historical earthquakes in Nepal, which was cleaned and preprocessed to ensure data quality. Earthquake patterns were visualized to identify trends and patterns that could be used to improve the model's performance. The model can be used to predict the severity of future earthquakes in Nepal, which can help to inform disaster preparedness and response efforts.

# Methodology

The following steps were taken to develop the predictive model:

1. Data collection and preprocessing: A dataset of historical earthquakes in Nepal was collected from various sources. The data was cleaned and preprocessed to ensure data quality. This involved removing outliers, imputing missing values, and scaling the data.
2. Feature engineering: New features were created from the existing data to improve the model's performance. For example, features such as the distance to the nearest fault line and the population density of the surrounding area were created.
3. Model selection: A Decision Tree Classifier was selected as the machine learning algorithm for the predictive model. Decision trees are a type of machine learning algorithm that can be used for both classification and regression tasks. They are easy to interpret and can be trained on relatively small datasets.
4. Model training and testing: The Decision Tree Classifier was trained on a subset of the dataset. The remaining subset of the dataset was used to test the model's performance.
5. Model evaluation: The model's performance was evaluated using a variety of metrics, including accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score. The model achieved an accuracy rate of 95% on the test dataset.
6. Earthquake pattern visualization: Earthquake patterns were visualized using a geographic information system (GIS) to identify trends and patterns that could be used to improve the model's performance. For example, the visualization showed that earthquakes are more likely to occur in certain regions of Nepal than others.
Results

The predictive model achieved an accuracy rate of 95% on the test dataset. This indicates that the model is able to predict the severity of future earthquakes in Nepal with a high degree of accuracy. The earthquake pattern visualization also revealed some interesting trends, such as the fact that earthquakes are more likely to occur in certain regions of Nepal than others.

# Conclusion

The predictive model developed in this study can be used to assess earthquake severity in Nepal with a high degree of accuracy. This information can be used to inform disaster preparedness and response efforts, and to help mitigate the damage caused by earthquakes.

# Future work

The predictive model can be further improved by collecting more data and incorporating new features. For example, data on the type of soil in the area and the age of the buildings in the area could be incorporated to improve the model's performance. The model can also be used to predict other aspects of earthquakes, such as the location of aftershocks.
